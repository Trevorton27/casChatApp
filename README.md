Let's Chat, Day-2-Nite

Have fun chatting with others in this chat app complete with a yummy night mode.  Built with Node.js, React.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL.

My goal with this project was to get some experience building a full stack application using the PERN stack.  Also, I wanted it to have an immensely relaxing UI.  Kick your feet up, pour yourself a martini, and send some emojis to a friend or two.  :)

Some more interesting facets of this chat app:
- Built using SocketIO for reduced chat lag time
- I learned how to include JSON Web Tokens in the authentication process.  

Things I'd like to add/improve upon:
- Adding a session cookie to the authentication process for enhanced security
- Secure username and password retrieval feature using an email address
- A 'like' feature
- A 'currently typing' feature
- Modular design

Enjoy!
